# Hi there 👋 I'm Barış Yerlikaya

🔧 I've been passionate about electronics and robotics since 2000,  
💻 and working as a software developer and manager since 2007.

🎮 I see software not just as a job, but as a part of my life:  
a game, an entertainment, a passion, a hobby, and a business. 😊

📚 I love learning, sharing what I know, and helping others grow.

🏢 I've had the opportunity to work across many industries:  
Telecom, Insurance, Valuation, Manufacturing, Tourism, Healthcare, Food, Electronics, and E-commerce.

🛠️ I have experience in all phases of software development:  
Analysis, Coding, Testing — and more.

🔌 I've also contributed to various industrial projects involving both software and hardware design.
