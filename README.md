Hi there, :wave: I'm BarÄ±ÅŸ Yerlikaya

I was born and live in Turkey.

I've been an electronics and robotics enthusiast since 2000 and a software developer and manager since 2007.

I'm married and a father of girls, and I really love my wife and daughter. ðŸ’•

I see software not as a job, but as a part of my life, a game, an entertainment, a passion, a hobby, a business. ðŸ˜Š

I love learning, sharing what I know, teaching.

I don't think there's anything I can't do technologically.  Maybe it's because I do what I've been asked to do so far.

I had the opportunity to work in many sectors such as telecom, insurance, valuation, production, tourism, health, food, electronics, e-commerce. 

I have experience in all phases of software development, including analysis, testing, coding.

I've also been involved in many industrial projects such as software and hardware design.
